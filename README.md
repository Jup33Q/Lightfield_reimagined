# Lightfield_reimagined
This is a collection of my TouchDesigner+Comfyui workflows that regenerates lightfield captured in blender with Alice-LKG plugins

## All external plugin used are:
#### a comfyui_td tunneling tools by JISEN, can find his video about tis on Billibilli
#### comfyui models from liblib and civitai, contronets from huggingface
#### Alice By LKG(looking glass factory), for primary quilt generating
