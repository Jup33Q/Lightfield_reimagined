# Lightfield_reimagined
This is a collection of my TouchDesigner+Comfyui workflows that regenerates lightfield captured in blender with Alice-LKG plugins

## All external plugin used are:
#### a comfyui_td tunneling tools by JISEN, can find his video about tis on Billibilli
#### comfyui models from liblib and civitai, contronets from huggingface
#### Alice By LKG(looking glass factory), for primary quilt generating

## what are in these files?
#### .toe are for Touchdesigner
#### the sample workflows is saved from Comfyui by Jisen's api plugins
#### the sample output includes a set of pink builings re_generated from a very simple quilted-scene from blender, and the .hop files are the light_field temp re-output from LKG studio
